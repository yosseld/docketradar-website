    DocketRadar Icon / Symbol Mark — Redesigned v2
    Concept: "Radar scanning a document, highlighting a change."

    The rounded square IS the document. Three radar arcs emanate from
    the bottom-left corner and sweep upward across the icon. Four
    horizontal document lines sit INSIDE the swept region, being "scanned."
    A teal blip sits ON the third document line at the exact point where
    the middle arc radius intersects that line — the detected change.

    One composition, one story: radar scanning a document and finding something.

    Brand colors:
      Navy (primary):  #1e3a5f
      Teal (accent):   #2dd4bf (on dark bg) / #0d9488 (on light bg)

    Geometry:
      Container: 120x120 rounded square, rx=26, offset (4,4)
      Radar origin: bottom-left at (20, 108)
      Arc 1 (inner):  r=34, sweep ~15deg to ~82deg
      Arc 2 (middle): r=56, sweep ~12deg to ~82deg
      Arc 3 (outer):  r=78, sweep ~10deg to ~82deg
      Document lines: 4 lines at y=38, 50, 62, 74
      Blip: on line 3 (y=62), x where r=56 crosses y=62
            distance from (20,108) at y=62 -> dy=46
            dx = sqrt(56^2 - 46^2) = sqrt(3136-2116) = sqrt(1020) = 31.9
            blip at (20+31.9, 62) = (52, 62) -- but shifted right for balance -> (56, 62)

  <!--
    Document lines — horizontal text lines INSIDE the radar sweep.
    These represent docket text being scanned. Each line sits between
    the arcs at progressively different depths. Lines get shorter as
    they go downward, echoing the arc curvature and creating a natural
    tapering that ties the document concept to the radar concept.
